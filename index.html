        game in Nintendo's <em>Super Mario</em> series. The game is set in out
        space, where Mario travels to different galaxies and planets to collect
        <u>Power Stars</u> by defeating enemys and completing quests. Can you
        save the universe from <strong>Bowser</strong> and rescue
        <strong>Princess Peach</strong>? Or will the Galaxy Remain without a
